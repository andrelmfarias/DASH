We detail distributed algorithms for scalable, secure multi-party linear regression and feature selection at essentially the same speed as plaintext regression. While the core geometric ideas are simple, their broad utility in combination is novel. Our scheme opens the door to efficient and secure genome-wide association studies across multiple biobanks.

[arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09531) and [R demo](https://github.com/jbloom22/DASH/blob/master/dash.r) of the distributed association scan hammer (DASH).

[Hail](https://hail.is/about.html) uses the single-party version to enable [massive genomic analyses](http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/) and will include the multi-party version someday. Also check out the exciting work on secure genomics by [Hoon Cho](https://hhcho.com/) and colleagues.

Apply by July 19 for an [RAAIS OpenMined Grant](https://blog.openmined.org/raais/) to get paid to add these algorithms to the core OpenMined code base.
