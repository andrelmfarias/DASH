# Secure multi-party linear regression at plaintext speed
##### [Jonathan Bloom](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/jonathan-bloom)

We detail a scheme for scalable, secure multi-party linear regression at essentially the same speed as plaintext regression. While the core ideas are simple, the recognition of their broad utility when combined is novel. By leveraging a recent advance in secure multiparty principal component analysis, our scheme opens the door to efficient and secure genome-wide association studies across multiple biobanks.
