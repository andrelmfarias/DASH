# Secure multi-party linear regression at plaintext speed

We detail distributed algorithms for scalable, secure multi-party linear regression and feature selection at essentially the same speed as plaintext regression. While the core geometric ideas are simple, the recognition of their broad utility when combined is novel. Our scheme opens the door to efficient and secure genome-wide association studies across multiple biobanks.

[arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09531) and [R demo](https://github.com/jbloom22/DASH/blob/master/dash.r) of the distributed association scan hammer (DASH).

Apply for the [RAAIS OpenMined Grant](https://blog.openmined.org/raais/) by July 19 to get paid to add these algorithms to the core OpenMined code base.

[Hail](https://hail.is/about.html) uses the single-party version to enable [massive genomic analyses](http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/) and will include the multi-party version some day. Also check out the exciting work on secure genomics by [Hoon Cho](https://hhcho.com/) and colleagues.
